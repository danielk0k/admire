# Admire

> Project has gone offline since May 2023

Admire is a place for owners to curate their own NFT art gallery from their collection, and invite people to admire them from anywhere in the world.

## Motivation

Admire is a project I started as part of [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) N&W S2 - a 6 week sprint to build anything. While the project draws similarities from my previous project [Koala Planner](https://github.com/danielk0k/koalaplanner), the main difference was the use of the [Alchemy NFT API](https://www.alchemy.com/nft-api) for fast NFT metadata queries.
